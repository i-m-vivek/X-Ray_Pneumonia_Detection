# In Progress
This app will detect the presence of [Pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia) by looking at the X-Ray photos. <br>
* The dataset can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).
* Images are resized to (128, 128).
* A baseline code can be found [here](https://github.com/i-m-vivek/X-Ray_Pneumonia_Detection/blob/master/chest_x_ray.py).

> Note: Currently this app is in progress. Suggestions are highly appreciated.
